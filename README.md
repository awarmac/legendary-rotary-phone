Personal blog. In due time, will include trip reports, a call to an avalanche api (this will display the data), data analysis on running, a general blog, etc. 

To run backend from api directory,
use `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000`

Web: `npm run dev`

Ensure proper dependencies are installed (node.js, uvicorn, etc)

Check health at localhost:3000 when both web and api are running.
Default api port 8000, default web 3000. 

Domain name coming soon.
